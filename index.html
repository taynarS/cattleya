        <ul>
            <li>Large and Colorful Flowers: The flowers of the Cattleya can vary in a wide range of colors, including shades of pink, purple, white, yellow, orange, and even green. The petals are large, with soft edges and usually a rounded shape or wide opening.</li>

            <li>Size and Growth: Cattleya orchids can vary from small to large, with flowers that can reach up to 20 cm in diameter in some species. The plant grows epiphytically, meaning it grows on trees but is not parasitic; instead, it uses the trees as support.</li>
